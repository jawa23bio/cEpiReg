# cEpiReg
cEpiReg constructs a comprehensive database elucidating the intricate regulatory mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) genetics. Through integrating data from scRNA seq and sc-ATAC seq, we identified the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) by comparing our results against various databases like ENCODE, Epimap, GWAS Catalog, and publicly available datasets. This project establishes a robust framework connecting transcription factors (TFs), CREs, and target genes. cEpiReg uncovers hidden regulatory links that could piece together missing links crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis.
